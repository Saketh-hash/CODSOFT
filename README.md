# TASK 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python and 'tkinter' for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows users to play against the computer and keeps track of scores across multiple rounds.

## Features

- User Input: Players can choose between rock, paper, or scissors using buttons in the GUI.
- Computer Selection: The computer randomly selects its move.
- Game Logic: Determines the winner based on the classic rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.
- Result Display: Displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, and whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie.
- Score Tracking: Tracks and displays scores for both the player and the computer.
- Play Again: Allows the user to play multiple rounds and resets the game for each new round.
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).


# TASK 3: Simple Calculator

## Features

- Addition: Adds two numbers.
- Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
- Division: Divides the first number by the second number with error handling for division by zero.
- Reset: Clears the input fields and resets the result label.
- Error Handling: Handles invalid input characters and displays an error message if the inputs are invalid numbers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (comes pre-installed with Python)
