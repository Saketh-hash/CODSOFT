# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python and 'tkinter' for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows users to play against the computer and keeps track of scores across multiple rounds.

## Features

- **User Input:** Players can choose between rock, paper, or scissors using buttons in the GUI.
- **Computer Selection:** The computer randomly selects its move.
- **Game Logic:** Determines the winner based on the classic rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.
- **Result Display:** Displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, and whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie.
- **Score Tracking:** Tracks and displays scores for both the player and the computer.
- **Play Again:** Allows the user to play multiple rounds and resets the game for each new round.


- Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
